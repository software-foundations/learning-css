CSS concepts

## Introduction

- Css means Cascade Style Sheet
- Use class in tags and use class selector in css is strongly recommended
- Classes with less things are easier to be reused
- Tradeoff: generalist class x all responsabilities in only specialized class
- generalist class -> reuse
- specialized class -> component
